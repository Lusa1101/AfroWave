### 🌍 Project Overview

**AfroWave** is a research-driven web application that bridges the cultural data gap in music AI by enabling users to engage with African music genres through interactive audio classification and storytelling.

The project serves dual purpose:
- **Research**: Investigating representation gaps in mainstream music datasets
- **Engagement**: Building public understanding of African genre identities through play

---

### 🧪 Research Objectives

- Explore how genre classification models handle African musical forms
- Analyze user interaction data to inform culturally-aware model evaluation
- Demonstrate inclusive, low-bandwidth-friendly UI design for underrepresented regions

> _"AfroWave isn’t just a tool — it’s a statement on how cultural nuance must be part of AI’s future."_
